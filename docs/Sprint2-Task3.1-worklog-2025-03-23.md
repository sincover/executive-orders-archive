## Task Assignment: Task 3.1: Create Application Context
## Sprint: 2
## Date Range: 2025-03-23 - 2025-03-23

### Task Description
Create application context for state management, including provider component, initial state, reducer functions, and custom hooks.

### Work Log

#### 2025-03-23
**Summary**: 
Created the application context infrastructure, including AppContext, provider component, reducer functions, custom hooks, tests, and a demo component.

**Details**:
- Created the AppContext.tsx file with the following components:
  - A strongly typed AppState interface defining all state properties
  - A typed AppAction type with all possible action types
  - A well-structured initial state with reasonable defaults
  - A reducer function to handle all state updates
  - A provider component with dark mode class management
  - A base useAppContext hook and specialized hooks for different state aspects
- Added specialized hooks for easier state consumption:
  - useOrderSelection: For managing the selected order
  - useFilters: For managing filters with set and reset capabilities
  - useTimelineRange: For controlling the timeline range
  - useDarkMode: For toggling dark mode with localStorage persistence
  - useViewMode: For switching between different view modes
- Developed comprehensive tests for all context functionality:
  - Tests for state initialization
  - Tests for all action types
  - Tests for hooks outside provider (error cases)
  - Tests for localStorage persistence
  - Tests for DOM manipulation (dark mode)
- Created a ContextTester component to demonstrate the context usage:
  - Component has sections for each part of the context state
  - Interactive UI with buttons to trigger state changes
  - Visualization of current state values
- Updated the main App component to use the AppProvider
- Ensured the context integrates well with the existing QueryClient

**Decisions made with justification**:
- Created specialized hooks for different aspects of state rather than just exposing the general context. This approach follows the principle of separation of concerns and makes components more focused.
- Implemented localStorage persistence for dark mode to enhance user experience by remembering preferences.
- Added a "view" state property to support different visualization modes (timeline, list, grid) which will be useful for future implementation.
- Used TypeScript for strong typing of all context elements to improve maintainability and developer experience.
- Built a comprehensive test suite to ensure all context functionality works correctly.

**TODO for next session**:
- Integrate the context with actual timeline components
- Connect context with the API for data filtering
- Ensure all components respect the selected dark mode

### Completion Summary
**Status**: Completed
**Percentage Complete**: 100%
**Challenges**: 
- Designing a state structure that handles all current and anticipated needs
- Balancing the complexity of the context implementation with ease of use
- Ensuring proper typing for all context elements

**Lessons Learned**:
- Breaking down the context into specialized hooks significantly improves the developer experience
- Comprehensive testing of context is essential as it forms the foundation of application state
- Maintaining a clean separation between UI components and state logic improves maintainability

**Additional Notes**:
The implementation follows the Glass Card Design System and is ready for integration with the timeline components in the next tasks.
